# rest-api-development

This is a simple example of a RESTful API, implemented using Python Flask within a Docker environment. Users are allowed to post "public" diary entries that can be seen by everyone using the app, or post "private" entries that can only be seen by themselves.

To run, simply run run.sh. You would need to have docker installed first. By default, the website runs on port 80 and the endpoints run on port 8080. This can be changed in ./run.sh
